# Find Me App

## Project Overview

Find Me is a web application designed to help users report and search for lost or found items. It provides a platform for individuals to post items they have lost or found and allows others to claim or report on these items. The system facilitates communication between users through an integrated messaging feature, making it easier to coordinate the return of items.

## Features

- **User Accounts**: Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Item Management**: Users can post items they have lost or found, complete with descriptions, categories, and images.
- **Search and Filter**: Enhanced search capabilities allow users to find items based on categories, date, and location.
- **Claims Management**: Users can claim items they believe are theirs and approve or reject claims made on their posts.
- **Real-time Messaging**: A built-in messaging system enables direct communication between users regarding items.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works well on both desktops and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: For the backend server and application logic.
